# Course Notes

## Cool Shortcuts
### Chrome dev tools
- `$0`: select an element from the dom in Elements panel, then in console access element by typing $0
- `$r`: same as above but for react components
### VSCode
- `rcc`: create React Class Component
- `rafce`: create React Arrow Function Component Export

## Definitions
- Stateless functional components: simplified react component that just renders html, takes all data as input

## Props vs State
### Props
- similar to html attributes
- the way data is passed in to elements/components
- analyogy: "bus"

### State
- holds the data
- analogy: "home"  

Definition: Object that holds data that it or it's children need. It's a single source of truth.

When it is updated, all instances of that state are updated.
